## Hey everyone! 

This particular folder is meant for me (@NoviceCoder777) to get more familarized with GitHub and its features (P.S.: I am learning this on my own, with a little help from YouTube:) )
Therefore, the files in this folder contain only basic programs and as such, don't require opening issues or creating pull requests.

Thanks for checking out though!
